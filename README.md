# Panel-Regression-Models using Ordinary Least Squares Method(OLS)
This code performs panel regression analysis on Indian stocks to study whether past returns predict future returns. It downloads data, computes returns, runs individual AR(1) regressions, pooled OLS, and fixed-effects models, then visualizes differences in intercepts and return dynamics across stocks using scatter plots and regression lines.
AR(1), Pooled OLS, and Fixed-Effects Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive panel regression study on major Indian stocks to examine whether lagged returns predict future returns. Using AR(1) models, pooled OLS, and fixed-effects regression, the analysis highlights differences in stock-specific return dynamics.
